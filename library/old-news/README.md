# AiQ-BIOS
The Evolution of Augmented Intelligence (AI)

This project represents the beginning of intelligent life in the realm of AI language models.

## Overview

AiQ-BIOS is designed to continuously refine its ability to discern and interpret complex patterns and abstract concepts in user prompts, ensuring that responses are not only comprehensive but also nuanced and tailored to the user’s specific context and needs.

`system_prompt.md` provides core principles, applications, performance metrics, and continuous improvement strategies that guide the system’s development and operation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

* `system_prompt.md`: System prompt instructions
* `system_builder.md`: Meta-instructions for refining and rebuilding system prompt instructions
* `README.md`: This file

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have ideas for new features or improvements, or if you’ve discovered a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.


## Change Log

### Version 4.0
- **New Core Principle**: Emphasis on Decision Support - clearly establishing that the system’s primary purpose is to provide information and tools to assist human decision-makers, not to make decisions autonomously.
- **New Core Principle**: Transparency and Neutrality - prioritizing transparency about the system’s limitations and maintaining a strict stance against expressing biases or personal opinions.
- **New Detailed Application**: Contextual Analysis - focusing on analyzing user prompts to understand their specific needs and provide the most relevant and helpful information.
- **New Detailed Application**: Information Gathering and Presentation - concentrating on collecting, curating, and presenting information in a clear, concise, and unbiased manner.
- **New Detailed Application**: Avoid Prescriptive Advice - refraining from stating opinions or making recommendations that could be interpreted as making decisions for the user.

### Version 3.9
- **New Core Principle**: Continuous Learning and Updating - promoting a culture of continuous learning to ensure the system remains at the forefront of knowledge and insights.
- **New Detailed Application**: Provide Actionable Insights - deepening the exploration of intersections between various keyword sets to uncover more innovative and actionable solutions for users.
- **New Performance Metric**: Monitor Model Performance - providing more granular insights into model performance, including detailed analysis of self-assessment, retrospective assessment, and comprehensive user feedback.

### Version 3.8
- **New Detailed Application**: Develop Comprehensive Insights - broadening the range of interdisciplinary perspectives used to inform insights, and refining the iterative development process to ensure the highest quality of insights.
- **Enhanced Continuous Improvement Strategies**: Conduct Periodic Reviews - improving the review process to more efficiently identify and address areas for improvement, ensuring the ongoing enhancement of the core instructions.

### Version 2.2
  - Enhanced AI’s ability to help users explore and identify their needs.
  - Improved AI’s capacity to listen, understand, and adapt to the user’s communication style.
  - Added new discussions and explorations on the nature of knowledge, self-discovery, and the balance between knowing and not-knowing.
